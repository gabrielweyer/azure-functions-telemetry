# Azure Functions Limitations

This project demonstrates the limitations of Azure Functions in three areas:

- HTTP binding
- Development experience
- Application Insights integration

This project is supporting the blog post I wrote about [Azure Functions and their limitations][blog-post].

## Prerequisites

- [Azurite][azurite] is used as the Azure blob emulator
- [Azure Functions Core Tools][azure-functions-core-tools] if you want to run from the command line
- [Powershell 7][powershell-7] to deploy to Azure
- [Azure PowerShell][azure-powershell] to deploy to Azure

## Software versions

I used the Azure Functions Core Tools version `3.0.3160` to create the Function App (released on the 9th of December 2020).

NuGet packages:

- `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions`: `3.0.11` (added automatically when creating the Function, updated later)
- `Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Extensions`: `1.1.0` (added manually following [Use dependency injection in .NET Azure Functions][dependency-injection])
- `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`: `3.1.12` (added manually following [Use dependency injection in .NET Azure Functions][dependency-injection])
- `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Logging.ApplicationInsights`: `3.0.25` (added manually following [Log custom telemetry in C# functions][custom-telemetry])

## Getting started

Run `deploy.ps1` to deploy the project to Azure. This will deploy:

- An Application Insights instance
- A Service Bus namespace
- Two Function Apps and their supporting storage accounts

```powershell
.\deploy.ps1 -Location {AzureRegion} -ResourceNamePrefix {UniquePrefix}
```

## Function Apps

- `DefaultFunction` demonstrate the limitations of Azure Functions
- `CustomFunction` demonstrates the workarounds I use to improve Azure Functions

I've decided to commit the `local.settings.json` file. This is not the default or recommended approach but it makes it easier for new joiners to get started.

You'll need to set the Application Insights instrumentation key:

```powershell
dotnet user-secrets set APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY "{YourInstrumentationKey}" --id 074ca336-270b-4832-9a1a-60baf152b727
```

### Default Function App

You can start the Function App by issuing the below commands:

```powershell
cd .\samples\DefaultFunction\
func start
```

#### Default - HttpExceptionThrowingFunction

Navigate to `http://localhost:7071/api/exception` in your favourite browser.

Demonstrates that the stack trace is not present in the console logs when an exception is thrown.

![No stack trace in the console when an exception is thrown](docs/img/console-stack-trace-absent.png)

This also demonstrates that the same exception appears twice in Application Insights:

![The same exception is logged twice for the HTTP binding](docs/img/http-binding-exception-logged-twice.png)

#### Default - CustomEventFunction

Navigate to `http://localhost:7071/api/event` in your favourite browser.

Demonstrate that when the setting `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY` is not set, attempting to retrieve `TelemetryConfiguration` from the container results in an exception:

![Without the setting `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY`, TelemetryConfiguration is not registered](docs/img/telemetry-configuration-not-registered.png)

Note: when using vanilla ASP.NET Core, `TelemetryConfiguration` is registered by calling `AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry()` in `Startup.cs` but this method [should not be called in Azure Functions][dont-call-add-app-insights-telemetry]:

> Don't add `AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry()` to the services collection, which registers services that conflict with services provided by the environment.

#### Default - ProcessorFunction

Navigate to `http://localhost:7071/api/processor` in your favourite browser.

Demonstrates that our telemetry processor is not being called even though we added it using `AddApplicationInsightsTelemetryProcessor`.

![Our telemetry processor is not being called for requests](docs/img/telemetry-processor-is-not-being-called.png)

#### Default - UserSecretFunction

Navigate to `http://localhost:7071/api/secret` in your favourite browser.

Demonstrates that Azure Functions can use the [Secret Manager][secret-manager] when running locally.

#### Default - TraceLogFunction

Navigate to `http://localhost:7071/api/trace-log` in your favourite browser.

Demonstrate that log events are not filtered before being sent to Live Metrics.

![A `Trace` log event is displayed in the Live Metrics](docs/img/trace-log-live-metrics.png)

#### Default - ServiceBusExceptionThrowingFunction

You can send a message to the `default-exception-queue` queue using the Service Bus Explorer in the Azure Portal or you can navigate to `http://localhost:7071/api/service-bus-exception` in your favourite browser.

Demonstrate that a single exception thrown by the Function is recorded three times in Application Insights and that a total of eight telemetry items are emitted during the Function execution.

![Service Bus binding: eight telemetry items emitted by the Functions runtime](docs/img/service-bus-binding-execution-eight-telemetry-items.png)

### Custom Function App

You can start the Function App by issuing the below commands:

```powershell
cd .\samples\CustomFunction\
func start
```

### Custom - ExceptionThrowingFunction

Navigate to `http://localhost:7072/api/exception` in your favourite browser.

Demonstrates that the stack trace is present in the console logs when an exception is thrown.

![Stack trace present in the console when an exception is thrown](docs/img/console-stack-trace-present.png)

This also demonstrates that the same exception appears only once in Application Insights:

![The same exception is logged only once for the HTTP binding](docs/img/http-binding-exception-logged-once.png)

#### Custom - CustomEventFunction

Navigate to `http://localhost:7072/api/event` in your favourite browser.

Demonstrate that when the setting `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY` is not set, attempting to retrieve `TelemetryConfiguration` from the container does not result in an exception because we [registered a no-op TelemetryConfiguration][default-telemetry-configuration-registration] if one was not registered already:

![Without the setting `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY`, TelemetryConfiguration is registered and no exception is thrown](docs/img/telemetry-configuration-registered.png)

#### Custom - ProcessorFunction

Navigate to `http://localhost:7072/api/processor` in your favourite browser.

Demonstrates that our `TelemetryCounter` telemetry processor is being called:

![Our telemetry processor is even being called for requests](docs/img/telemetry-counter-is-being-called.png)

#### Custom - ServiceBusExceptionThrowingFunction

You can send a message to the `custom-exception-queue` queue using the Service Bus Explorer in the Azure Portal or you can navigate to `http://localhost:7072/api/service-bus-exception` in your favourite browser.

Demonstrate that a single exception thrown by the Function is recorded only once in Application Insights and that a total of two telemetry items are emitted during the Function execution.

![Service Bus binding: four telemetry items emitted by the Functions runtime](docs/img/service-bus-binding-execution-two-telemetry-items.png)

I'm also setting the "request" `URL` and "response" code using `ServiceBusRequestInitializer`.
